A HTTP web server index for Apache httpd, lighttpd, and nginx.

**This is a fork of [lrsjng's h5ai][original], which appears to be no longer maintained.**


## Important

* Do **not** install any files from the `src` folder, they need to be
  preprocessed to work correctly!
* Find detailed install instructions on the [wiki][wiki].
* For bug reports and feature requests please use [issues][github-issues].
* Requires at least **PHP 7.0.0+**
* Tested with **PHP 8.4.0** and **nginx**


## Requirements

### Runtime (Server-side)
* PHP `7.0.0+`
* Web server (Apache httpd, lighttpd, nginx, cherokee, etc.)
* PHP extensions (depending on enabled features):
