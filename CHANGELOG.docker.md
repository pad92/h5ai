# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.7] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.2.7`. Fixed the background cache warmer crashing on startup (`warm-cache.php` accessed PHP's `$_SESSION`, which does not exist in a CLI process, so it died before doing any work); the documented cron-triggered cache warming now actually runs. Removed the dead `google-analytics-ua` extension (Universal Analytics was shut down in 2023) — drop any `google-analytics-ua` block from a customized `options.json`, `piwik-analytics` (Matomo) is unaffected.
- **s6-overlay Upgrade**: Updated s6-overlay from `3.1.6.2` to `3.2.3.0`. Upstream removed the default service startup timeout in 3.2.0.0, which does not affect this image since `S6_CMD_WAIT_FOR_SERVICES_MAXTIME=30000` is set explicitly.
- **Slimmer Image**: Removed packages nothing uses: `php84-intl` (plus its ICU data, h5ai never calls intl functions), `php84-xml`, `php84-simplexml`, `php84-xmlwriter`, `php84-pdo_sqlite` (CacheDB uses the `SQLite3` class directly) and the base image's `angie-console-light` console (never served). The `HEALTHCHECK` now uses busybox `wget` instead of `curl`, so `curl` is gone too. Same functionality, roughly 15 MB less.
- **Angie Config Cleanup**: Dropped the obsolete `msie6` keepalive/gzip directives and added `application/wasm` to `gzip_types` for h5ai's WebAssembly assets.

### Fixed
- **README Security Headers**: The feature list still advertised `X-XSS-Protection`, which was replaced by `Referrer-Policy` and `Content-Security-Policy` back in 1.2.0-1.
- **Broken Build Against h5ai 1.2.7**: h5ai 1.2.7 dropped the `avprobe`/`ffprobe` entries from the command-probe list in `class-setup.php`, shifting the context our local `class-setup.php.patch` (silencing missing-command shell noise) depended on; the build failed applying the patch. Updated the patch to match the new upstream source.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Makefile `help` Target**: Added a `help` target listing available targets (`build`, `test`, `trivy`, `clean`) and made it the default goal when running `make` with no arguments.

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.2.6`. Every icon (toolbar, tree, preview bar, and all file/folder types) is now self-hosted Font Awesome Free glyphs, including real brand marks where available (Android, Debian, Red Hat, Python, Rust, PHP, and more); the old "comity" icon theme is gone, merged into the sole `themes/default` theme.

### Fixed
- **Google Fonts Blocked by CSP**: h5ai loaded Ubuntu/Ubuntu Mono from a `fonts.googleapis.com` stylesheet and the bundled `movi-player` imported Google's Inter font; this project's `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` Content-Security-Policy silently blocked both. h5ai 1.2.6 self-hosts every font as `@font-face`, so no h5ai page requests an external host for icons, fonts, or styles anymore.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **User docker-compose Example**: Added a ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml` example (image `pad92/docker-h5ai:latest`); the previous development compose file was renamed to `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
- **Makefile Test**: Added a `make test` case covering a bind-mounted custom `options.json` (regression test for the startup failure below).

### Fixed
- **Bind-Mounted `options.json` Broke Startup**: the startup script rewrote the h5ai admin `passhash` with `sed -i`, whose rename fails (`EBUSY`) on a single-file bind mount; with `set -e` the init oneshot aborted and neither Angie nor PHP-FPM started. The file is now rewritten in place (temp file + `cat`). A read-only mounted `options.json` keeps its existing `passhash`; combining it with `H5AI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` aborts startup with an explicit error.
- **Basic Auth Fail-Open**: an `htpasswd` failure was silently ignored and the container started **without** the authentication requested through `ENV_U`/`ENV_P`. Startup now aborts with the `htpasswd` error instead (fail closed).
- **Unsupported Build Architecture**: the Dockerfile silently fell back to `x86_64` s6-overlay binaries for unknown `TARGETARCH` values; the build now fails explicitly.
- **Release Notes Extraction**: the CI release job unconditionally deleted the last extracted line, eating real content for the oldest CHANGELOG section; the line is now removed only when it is the next version header.

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.2.5`.
- **Healthcheck Hardening**: added explicit `HEALTHCHECK` parameters (`--interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=15s --retries=3`) and a 5 s curl timeout (`-m 5`).
- **CI Registry Logins**: switched the GitLab registry `docker login` calls to `--password-stdin` so the password no longer appears in process arguments.
- **Trivy Scan Gates the Published Digest**: on `main`/tag pipelines the build stage pushes a multi-platform candidate (`ci-<sha>`) to the GitLab registry and exports its manifest digest, Trivy scans both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` of that pinned digest, and the publish jobs promote the same digest to the final tags with `docker buildx imagetools create` instead of rebuilding. The published images are bit-identical to what was scanned, and publishing fails closed if the digest is missing. MR/branch pipelines keep scanning the local build artifact.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.2.4`.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.2.3`.
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Relaxed the CSP to support h5ai's WebAssembly-based features and media previews: added `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to `script-src`, plus `worker-src 'self' blob:` and `media-src 'self' blob:`.

## [1.2.2-1] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **PUID/PGID Remapping**: Added `PUID`/`PGID` support so the runtime `angie` account is remapped at startup (via `usermod`/`groupmod -o`) to match the owner of bind-mounted shares. This prevents h5ai from silently hiding all entries (`hideIf403`) when shares are owned by a different uid/gid. Requires the newly added `shadow` package.

### Changed
- **Angie Upgrade**: Updated Angie to version `1.11.8`.
- **Angie Worker User**: Added `user angie;` to `angie.conf` so Angie workers run under the same account as php-fpm, ensuring direct file downloads also benefit from the PUID/PGID remapping.

### Fixed
- **Empty Listing Behind `clear_env`**: `clear_env = yes` in `php-fpm.conf` stripped `H5AI_ROOT_PATH` from worker environments, causing h5ai to fall back to the wrong directory and show an empty listing. Fixed by passing `env[H5AI_ROOT_PATH]` explicitly through `php-fpm.conf`.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Real Client IP Behind Reverse Proxy**: Added the `REAL_IP_FROM` (and optional `REAL_IP_HEADER`, default `X-Forwarded-For`) environment variables to declare trusted proxies. When set, an `/etc/angie/conf.d/real_ip.conf` is generated at startup with `set_real_ip_from` directives so Angie substitutes the real client IP from the forwarded header.
- **`php` Command Symlink**: Symlinked `/usr/bin/php` to `php84` so tooling that invokes `php` directly resolves correctly.

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.2.2`.
- **Access Log Format**: Switched the Angie access log to a `vhost_combined`-style format (vhost prefix `$host:$server_port`, `$remote_addr` as the first field) while preserving the `X-Forwarded-For` value and the existing upstream/timing fields.
- **PHP-FPM Hardening**: Set `clear_env = yes` so container environment variables (including secrets such as `ENV_P` and `H5AI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) are no longer exposed to PHP worker processes.
- **Cache Permissions**: Refined the startup permission fixup to apply `755` to directories and `644` to files, instead of `755` across everything.
- **Makefile**: Added `--load` to `docker buildx build` so the built image is available to the local Docker store; added `make test` cases covering the health check with basic auth enabled and the `REAL_IP_FROM` configuration.

### Fixed
- **Health Check With Basic Authentication**: The `HEALTHCHECK` no longer marks the container as `unhealthy` when basic auth is enabled. It now treats both `200` and `401` as healthy while still failing when Angie is unreachable.
- **Init Script Logic**: Removed a no-op `$?` check after `htpasswd` (dead code under `set -e`) by guarding the command directly with the conditional.

## [1.2.0-1] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **CI Docker Image Upgrade**: Upgraded CI/CD Docker-in-Docker image from `24.0.5` to `28` across build, test, and publish stages.
- **CI Publish Refactor**: Extracted a reusable `.publish-template` job template for multi-platform image publishing, removing duplication between GitLab and Docker Hub publish jobs.
- **Security Headers**: Replaced deprecated `X-XSS-Protection` header with `Referrer-Policy` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers in Angie configuration.
- **PHP OPcache JIT**: Disabled JIT compilation (`jit=disable`) to improve stability.
- **PHP-FPM Configuration**: Added `[global]` section with explicit PID file and error log paths; tightened socket permissions from `0666` to `0660` with `angie` group ownership.
- **Cache Ownership**: Changed cache directory ownership from `angie:www-data` to `angie:angie` for consistent permission model.
- **s6-overlay Timeout**: Changed `S6_CMD_WAIT_FOR_SERVICES_MAXTIME` from `0` (infinite) to `30000` (30 seconds) to detect stuck services.
- **Makefile Improvements**: Replaced hardcoded `sleep` waits with retry-based HTTP polling helpers (`wait_for_http`, `wait_for_http_auth`); switched build command to `docker buildx build`.

### Fixed
- **Reproducible Builds**: Pinned `php-rar` extension build to a specific git commit and copied the compiled `rar.so` via a stable intermediate path.
- **Init Script Safety**: Added `set -e` to the permissions initialization script for fail-fast behavior on errors.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **PHP Version Upgrade**: Upgraded base image PHP version to `8.4` (Alpine-based), including path updates for the `rar` extension and s6-overlay configurations.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.7` (adds audio thumbnail generation using ffmpeg/avconv, close/stop button to the audio player queue, and background/asynchronous foldersize caching via a CLI helper refresh script).

## [1.1.6] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.6` (rebuilds tree on refresh to prevent collapse while preserving node state, moves no-cache HTTP headers to list API response only, defaults unset ROOT_PATH to parent of H5AI_PATH, adds isContentFetched tracking, cleans dark theme CSS rules, and expands type mappings in configurations).

## [1.1.5] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.5` (resolves aggressive caching of directory data by adding HTTP cache control headers to API responses, fixes folder list refresh tree-view updates, fixes item model bug that marked parent content fetched prematurely, and restores search/filter colors/visibility in dark mode).

## [1.1.4] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **SQLite3 Support**: Added `php83-sqlite3` and `php83-pdo_sqlite` extensions to enable database/SQLite3 caching support in PHP.
- **RAR Archive Support**: Compiled and installed the `rar` extension from git source to ensure compatibility with PHP 8.3.
- **Path Customization**: Added the `H5AI_ROOT_PATH=/share` environment variable to support customizable root folder mappings.

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.4` (adds alternating list row colors / zebra striping, fixes dark mode link hover tone-on-tone readability issues, and introduces smooth hover highlights for lists).

### Fixed
- **Redundant Permissions Configuration**: Cleaned up build-time cache directories `chown` in the Dockerfile, relying entirely on the runtime s6-overlay permission setup.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.3` (adds dynamic version display in the info page header/backlinks, adjusted build versioning logic, and CI/CD release pipeline fixes).

### Fixed
- **s6-overlay Startup Timeout**: Configured `S6_CMD_WAIT_FOR_SERVICES_MAXTIME=0` to prevent s6-overlay from timing out during slow container startup.
- **Permissions Optimization**: Optimized the startup permissions initialization script to only run `chown` and `chmod` on files/directories with incorrect owner/group or permissions, speeding up container boot when cache volumes are populated.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Administration Password Configuration**: Added support for a `H5AI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable to automatically set the SHA-512 `passhash` configuration in `options.json` at startup. If not provided, a random password is generated at boot and written to the startup logs.

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.2` (adds dynamic version display in the topbar backlink, global repository migration to `pad92`, and new administrative documentation).
- **Process Manager Migration**: Migrated process management from Supervisor to s6-overlay (v3), which forwards UNIX signals correctly and restarts failed services automatically.
- **Image Size Optimization**: Reduced final unpacked image size from 391MB to 321MB (saving 70MB, or ~18% reduction) by removing Supervisord and its Python 3 runtime dependencies.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Added dynamic architecture mapping in the Dockerfile builder stage to download the matching s6-overlay binaries for `TARGETARCH`, so the same Dockerfile builds both `amd64` and `arm64` images.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.1` (adds loop detection and symlink verification to prevent infinite recursion, and visited path tracking to prevent circular traversals).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.1.0` (redesigned modern glassmorphic audio player with persistent playback and queue management, optimized folder size caching, secured CacheDB queries, and added new automated CI/CD and security audit checks).
- **Build Process Optimization**: Modified the Docker image builder stage to download the pre-compiled `h5ai` zip package directly from the public GitLab Generic Packages Registry instead of git cloning and compiling it from source.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded default h5ai base version to `1.0.0` (migrated build system from ghu to gulp, added WebP thumbnail support, limited image previews to 80% screen width, and fixed CacheDB/filesize check errors).

  - Hardened permissions initialization script by creating cache folders dynamically before configuring their permissions.

## [0.30.0-9] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Automatic Cache Permissions**: Added a Supervisor initialization task (`init_perms.sh`) to automatically set the correct ownership (`nginx:www-data`) and write permissions (`755`) on cache directories at startup.

## [0.30.0-8] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded built h5ai base version to `0.30.0-pad92.3`.

## [0.30.0-7] - 2026-06-12

- **Docker Compose Cleanup**: Removed obsolete version parameter and adjusted volume structure.

## [0.30.0-6] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Persistent Cache Documentation**: Added instructions in `README.md` to persist public (thumbnails) and private cache across container restarts via volume mounts.

### Changed
- **h5ai Base Upgrade**: Upgraded the compiled h5ai base version to `0.30.0-pad92.1` using the `pad92/h5ai` custom fork, which integrates `movi-player` for modernized video previews, upgrades the `marked` library, and enables cross-origin isolation.

## [0.30.0-5] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **GitLab Release Automation**: Configured `release-cli` in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate GitLab Release pages from tag descriptions in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Security Headers**: Enabled `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-XSS-Protection` headers in the Nginx configuration.
- **Access Control**: Explicitly blocked external access to the `/_h5ai/private` directory with a 403 Forbidden rule.

### Changed
- **Stack Upgrade**: Upgraded base image to Nginx 1.26 (Alpine-slim) and PHP to version 8.3 (upgraded from PHP 8.1), including path updates and packages optimization.
- **Node.js Build Environment**: Upgraded builder environment to Node 20 (Alpine) and enabled openssl legacy provider to compile dependencies.
- **Process Manager**: Changed Supervisord config to automatically restart (`autorestart=true`) PHP-FPM and Nginx processes on failure.
- **UNIX Signal Handling**: Added `exec` command to start Nginx to ensure proper signal forwarding and graceful container shutdowns.
- **GitLab CI Migration**: Migrated the pipeline from GitHub Actions to GitLab CI/CD, configuring a 5-stage workflow (lint, build, test, scan, publish) run on the `chataigne` runner.
- **CI/CD Build & Caching**: Replaced multiple build jobs with a parameterized, single-build pattern. Configured multi-platform compilation (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) using Docker Buildx and registry caching (`type=registry`) to speed up builds.
- **CI/CD Security Scanner**: Upgraded Trivy vulnerability scanning tool to scan built image tarballs locally, removing the need for a Docker daemon in the scan stage.
- **Dockerfile & Makefile Cleanups**: Standardized Dockerfile label inputs (`BUILD_DATE`, `BUILD_VCSREF`) and parameterized the target hostname (`TEST_HOST`) to ease local validation.

### Fixed
- **Basic Authentication scope**: Extended authentication protection to cover both the indexing layout page and direct static file downloads by moving the authentication config to the root block. Added safe checks to only enable authentication if both `ENV_U` and `ENV_P` variables are non-empty.
- **Functional Validation**: Rewrote authentication test scripts to resolve test runner gateways by dynamically querying internal container IP addresses on the bridge network.
